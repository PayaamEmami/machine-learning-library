# Machine Learning Library

A C++ machine learning library focused on classical ML algorithms, neural networks, and ensemble methods.

> **Note:** This project is created purely for learning purposes. It's an educational implementation of machine learning algorithms to better understand their inner workings and implementation details.

## Current Status
ðŸš§ In Progress â€“ This project is actively being developed. Features and structure may change as work continues.

## Planned Features

### Machine Learning Models
- **Classical ML:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees
- **Neural Networks:** Single Layer Perceptron (SLP), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformers
- **Ensemble Methods:** Gradient Boosting, Random Forest

## Contributing
ðŸ”’ Currently a solo project â€“ no external contributions planned for now.
